/// Which registry device a live BLE link's samples belong to (#1881).
///
/// Split out of `BLEManager` because it is the whole of the decision and none of the CoreBluetooth: BLE
/// behaviour cannot be tested in CI, but *this* can, and it is the part that silently files rows under the
/// wrong device when it is wrong. The Kotlin twin is `com.noop.ble.SourceIdentity`.
///
/// The bug it exists to prevent: `BLEManager` held one `deviceId` meaning "the active device" and reused it
/// as "the device these bytes came from". Those were the same thing only while every registered device was
/// a WHOOP. Once a ring could be active, a WHOOP connection filed its samples — including `stepSample` and
/// `gravitySample`, which only a strap can produce — under the ring's id.

    /// Conservative by construction. It returns an id ONLY when a registry row is both matched by peripheral
    /// and a WHOOP, so every uncertain case keeps today's behaviour rather than guessing:
    ///   • `address` nil, or no row carries it → nil. This is the legacy single-WHOOP row before it has
    ///     adopted a `peripheralId`; the coordinator adopts one on this same connect, so the next resolves.
    ///   • the matched row is not a WHOOP → nil. Nothing else should be arriving on the WHOOP delegate, and
    ///     if it does, re-pointing the strap's id at it would be the very bug this prevents.
    ///   • the matched row is already the current id → nil, so there is no write on the common path.
    ///   • an ARCHIVED row never matches. Archive means "stop connecting, keep data", and a strap that was
    ///     removed and re-added keeps its address, so its archived legacy row and its new row share one
    ///     `peripheralId`. Taking the first match by `addedAt` picked the archived one, and the analyze scan
    ///     does not read archived devices — every night the strap recorded scored as empty.
    ///   • two live rows with one address → the ACTIVE row, the device the user chose.
    ///
    /// Matching is case-insensitive because the two platforms disagree about case: Apple stores an uppercase
    /// `CBPeripheral.identifier.uuidString`, Android an uppercase MAC — but neither is guaranteed by the OS,
    /// and a row written by an older build may carry either.
